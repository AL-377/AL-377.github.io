😎 Hi, I am Junting Lu (Aidan Lew), currently a second-year master student at Institute for Software Engineering, Peking University (PKU). Prior to that, I received the B.S. degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU) in 2023. 

My current research interests primarily focus on:
- **Tool Learning**: Explore how to endow large models with higher-order tool use abilities.
- **OS Agent**: Investigate the development of intelligent agents that utilize (multi-modal) large language models
((M)LLMs) to operate within operating systems (OS) environments, enhances user interactions.
- **Native VLM Agent**: Advancing research on equipping MLLMs with hybird Agent abilities.
